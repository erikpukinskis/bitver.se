Possible Attacks
================

Party X could offer to pay miners to **blacklist** a client or a service. But there would then be a market opportunity for someone who either doesn't know about Party X, or doesn't care, who will offer the service. It's difficult to keep money on the table. Under an auction system it would become very difficult to prevent someone from stepping in.

In the cause of **fraudulent computation**, you'd have to get to a huge slice of the network to do it reliably, because of the randomly selected relays.

**Abuse of Voluntary Censorship Systems** - Given the likelihood of a voluntary censorship system, where the FBI might flag child pornography so that miners could refuse to distribute it, such systems could be abused.  If the FBI flags you private personal communications as child porn, it'd be difficult to clear your name without revealing your private key.
